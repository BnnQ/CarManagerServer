# Description

CarManager is a simple yet efficient web application designed as an admin dashboard for managing cars. It allows users to add, edit, and delete car entries, providing a streamlined interface for car management.

The [client-side](https://github.com/BnnQ/CarManagerClient) of CarManager is built with Angular 15, a popular and robust framework for creating dynamic and responsive web applications. It leverages Angular's Dependency Injection and routing capabilities to ensure a modular and maintainable codebase.

The server-side is written with ExpressJS, a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. This combination of technologies ensures that CarManager is not only efficient and fast, but also scalable and maintainable.

Despite its simplicity, CarManager stands out for its comfortable interface and efficiency, making it a handy tool for anyone involved in car management.
